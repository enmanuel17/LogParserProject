# LogParserProject
This is the code for third udacity project. The code allows you to use python to interface with a postgresql database. psycopg2 was the python-db API implemented in this project.

Some of the installing and setting up instructions were provided by udacity.

### Downloads

The code can be downloaded from the following repo:

https://github.com/enmanuel17/LogParserProject.git

## REQUIREMENTS:
### Python 3 ONLY. How to get/install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the following python libraries:

- psycopg2
```pip3 install psycopg2```
for more info regarding the library look here http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html

The code also needs a backend server that runs the database. To accomplish that, we will need to install and run
the following software on that order:

### How to get/install VirtualBox
We will be using virtual box to create a virtual machine for running our server.
You can download it from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1, here. Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

### How to get/install Vagrant
We will be using vagrant to configure the necessary packages for the server to run.
Download Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and install the version for your operating system.
Once that is completed, git clone the vagrant configuration file we are going to use https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git
cd into the clone and hange to this directory in your terminal with cd. Inside, you will find another directory called vagrant. Change directory to the vagrant. Once in there, run vagrant up. (This will take a while the OS is download, install and configured.)
When vagrant up is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run vagrant ssh. Now you are in your db server.

### How to get the database
Download the database data from here https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip . You can use the wget command to download zip file from within the VM. Once dowloaded, use the unzip command to extract the contents in the /vagrant directory inside the VM. The file inside is called newsdata.sql.
use the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql inside the VM to populate the database server with the database.

## Views needed
Please create this view before running the code
In the command from the VM run the following:
```psql -d news```
```create view dates as```
```select cast(time as date) as date from log group by cast(time as date);```
Then CTRL + D to exit.

## How to Use:
Some of the steps might be optional if you went throught the requierments section.
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the program files
2. Run the command vagrant up, then vagrant ssh
3. Go to the vagrant directory (program files)
4. Load the database with the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
5. Enter the database ```psql -d news and enter the SQL Views, then exist the database```
6. Run the application:
- Typing ```python dbParselog.py``` from the linux command line.
7. Enjoy the output results displayed on the terminal
